This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Technlogies used:

### - ReactJS (Front framework)

</p>

React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components.

**My opinion**: This year I wanted to start working on web development on my free time. I then did some research to choose a front framework and found out that React was very popular and developers enjoyed using it. I then decided to learn it and I wasn't disapointed. The syntax is very easy and if you're familiar with JavaScript you won't have any problems learning and using React. Plus functionnal components and hooks made it a lot more easier and fun.

### - TypeScript (Main language)

</p>

TypeScript is a programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft in 2012. It is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript and adds optional static typing to the language.

**My opinion**: TypeScript has gained a lot of popularity this past few years, and it shouldn't be surprising since it allowsyou to catch a lot of errors as soon as you wirte the code and not when executed like for JavaScript. Plus typing adds good documentation inside your code.

### - TailwindCSS (CSS Framework)

</p>

TailwindCSS is a "utility-first" CSS framework that provides a deep catalog of CSS classes and tools that lets you easily get started styling your website or application.

**My opinion**: This project was the first time for me using TailwindCSS. I found it quite practical since you can directly write your CSS in your HTML/JSX with a lot of utilities, it's like an overpowered inline-styling so no need to write .css files. You can also customise themes,colors...

### - MaterialUI (UI kit/framework)

<p align="center">

</p>

Material-UI, the world's most popular React UI framework. It provides a huge set of components for faster web development.

**My opinion**: Very practical components so you don't need to build everything from scratch plus it provides good way of customising.

### - Others

- **react-router**: Provides navigation components for routing and enabling multiple pages React app.

- **axios**: Promise based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js. Useful for API calls.

- **react-final-form**: React Final Form is a thin React wrapper for Final Form, which is a subscriptions-based form state management library that uses the Observer pattern, so only the components that need updating are re-rendered as the form's state changes.

- **ESLint+Prettier**: ESLint is a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code. It alows better structuring of the code. Prettier is used for formating.
